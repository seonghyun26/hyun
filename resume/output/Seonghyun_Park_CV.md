# Summary

I'm a 1st-year Ph.D. candidate in at KAIST AI, advised by [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215). My master’s research focused on solving the over-squashing phenomenon in graph neural networks (GNNs). Currently, I am integrating machine learning with molecular dynamics (MD) to advance scientific discovery. Most recently, I led a project on machine learning–based collective variables for enhanced sampling simulations of proteins, leveraging foundation models.
