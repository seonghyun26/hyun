# Summary

I'm a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Graduate School of AI at KAIST, advised by [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215). My Master’s research focused on addressing the over-squashing phenomenon in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture long-range interactions in molecule graphs. Currently, my research focuses on **AI for Science (AI4Science)**, specifically integrating machine learning with biomolecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD). Recently, I led a project on machine learning–based collective variables (CVs) for enhanced sampling of proteins, by repurposing foundation models.
